# MngoDb_Nodejs_CRUD_Opreration_Project
 Project Description The MongoDB and Node.js CRUD Operation Project is a simple web application that demonstrates the fundamental principles of Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) operations using the MongoDB database and the Node.js runtime environment. This project provides a straightforward API for managing data within a MongoDB database, making it an excellent starting point for developers looking to learn or build applications using these technologies.  Key Features Create: You can add new items to the database by sending a POST request to the /api/items endpoint. Each item consists of a name and description.  Read: Retrieve a list of all items stored in the database using a GET request to /api/items. You can also retrieve a specific item by its unique ID with a GET request to /api/items/:id.  Update: Modify existing items by sending a PUT request to /api/items/:id with updated information in the request body. This allows you to change the name and description of an item.  Delete: To remove an item from the database, send a DELETE request to /api/items/:id. This operation deletes an item based on its unique ID.  Prerequisites Before getting started with this project, you should have the following prerequisites in place:  Node.js and npm installed on your development machine. MongoDB installed and running either locally or on a remote server. A basic understanding of MongoDB and Node.js concepts. Installation To set up the project, follow these simple steps:  Clone this repository to your local machine.  Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.  Run npm install to install the project dependencies.  Configure the MongoDB connection by updating the MongoDB connection URL in the config.js file.  Usage Start the Node.js server by running npm start, which will make the API accessible on the default port (usually 3000). You can customize the port in the config.js file. Once the server is running, you can interact with the API using tools like Postman or by making HTTP requests via your web browser.  Contributing We welcome contributions from the community!
